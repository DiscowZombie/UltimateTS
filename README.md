# UltimateTS

UltimateTs is a simple plugin, allowed you to interact easly with your TeamSpeak server. With UltimateTS, you can link your accounts (and your ranks), send broadcast on TeamSpeak and more !
You can link your MC accounts and TeamSpeak simply. If you would like to link ranks, you need a permission plugins (like PermissionsEx, zPerms, LuckPerms, Vault,...). You can also choose to link MC accounts and TeamSpeak accounts without linking ranks.
When the TeamSpeak and Minecraft accounts are linked, the player have a custom description like "MC Name: name".
